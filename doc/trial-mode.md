Trial Mode
==========

Features in trial mode have recently been added and are not yet complete. They are experimental, may have bugs, and may be removed in the future. If EMC flags up a trial mode feature in your code, be warned that it may produce unexpected results, or be removed at any point. In alpha and beta, this could be any time. Once EMLI reaches a full release, it will be the next major or minor version.
